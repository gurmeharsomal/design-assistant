# Design Assistant

A web application that provides design feedback on uploaded images using a fine-tuned VLM model. This project includes both a backend (FastAPI) for processing images and generating feedback and a frontend (React) for the user interface.

## Features

- Upload images and receive constructive design feedback.
- Option to add a custom prompt for specific feedback.
- Responsive frontend built with React and TypeScript.
- Machine learning model deployed via FastAPI backend.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: FastAPI, Python, Uvicorn
- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Machine Learning: Hugging Face Transformers, custom fine-tuned model
- Deployment: Render

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Node.js >= 14
- Conda (optional but recommended for managing Python environments)

## Setup and Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-assistant.git
cd design-assistant
```

### Backend Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended with Conda):

```bash
conda create -n design-assistant-backend python=3.9
conda activate design-assistant-backend
```

2. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

3. Model Download:
   The model is automatically downloaded when the backend first runs. Note: The model processing may take some time to generate feedback, depending on its size and the available system resources.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Locally

### Start the Backend

In the design-assistant root directory, activate the virtual environment if using Conda, and start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Start the Frontend

Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and start the React development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Deployment

To deploy this project on Render using render.yaml:

1. Push all changes to your GitHub repository.
2. Create a new Blueprint on Render:
   - Go to the Render Dashboard.
   - Select New > Blueprint (YAML) and connect your repository.
3. Configure the services according to the render.yaml file.
4. Set up any necessary environment variables for each service.

**Note: The backend deployment requires more memory than the free plan provides so you will ne to upgrade.**

After deployment, Render will provide URLs for both the frontend and backend services.

## Usage

1. Open the frontend in your browser (e.g., http://localhost:3000 or Render-provided URL).
2. Upload an image (JPG/PNG) and enter an optional prompt.
3. Submit the form to receive design feedback generated by the model.
4. Check the results displayed on the page.

**Note: The model may take some time to process each image and generate feedback due to its complexity and the resources available.**
